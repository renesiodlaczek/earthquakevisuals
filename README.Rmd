The goal of earthquakevisuals is to ...

## Installation

You can install the development version of earthquakevisuals from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("renesiodlaczek/earthquakevisuals")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(earthquakevisuals)
## basic example code
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r}
library(earthquakevisuals)
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(lubridate)

data <- noaa_earthquakes |> 
    eq_clean_data() |>
    eq_location_clean()

data |> 
    dplyr::filter(country %in% c("ALASKA", "CHINA", "JAPAN")) |> 
    ggplot(aes(date)) +
    geom_timeline(xmin = as.Date("2000-01-01"), 
                  xmax = as.Date("2018-01-01")
                  ) +
    theme_classic() +
    theme(axis.line.y = element_blank(), 
          axis.ticks.y = element_blank(), 
          axis.text.y = element_blank()
          ) +
    labs(x = "DATE", 
         y = element_blank(), 
         title = "NOAA Earthquakes") +
    ylim(0.5, 2)
```

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub and CRAN.
