The goal of courseraFirstPackage is to provide functions to load and
analyze data from the US National Highway Traffic Safety
Administration’s Fatality Analysis Reporting System, which is a
nationwide census providing the American public yearly data regarding
fatal injuries suffered in motor vehicle traffic crashes. You can
download the data from
[here](https://www.nhtsa.gov/file-downloads?p=nhtsa/downloads/FARS/).

## Installation

You can install the development version of courseraFirstPackage from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("renesiodlaczek/courseraFirstPackage")
```

## Usage

Please refer to the vignette for a description how to use the package.

## Coursera Grading

Unfortunately a bug on Travis prevents to be able to test the package
there. It says that I have exceeded the number of users allowed for may
plan… Therefore I did the unit testing with github. This is the second
badge (R-CMD-check) at the top of this file.
